## About DevTinder

DevTinder is an innovative platform designed to connect developers with exciting projects and collaborators, inspired by the popular "Tinder" matching mechanic. Instead of swiping for dates, developers can swipe through project ideas, potential team members, or open-source contributions. The goal is to streamline the process of finding the right fit for your skills, interests, and availability, fostering a vibrant community of passionate developers.

## Features

* **Developer Profiles:** Create comprehensive profiles showcasing skills, technologies, experience, and project preferences.
* **Project Listings:** Browse and filter projects based on technologies, skill levels, project types (open-source, freelance, startup), and more.
* **Swipe-Based Matching:** Intuitively "like" or "pass" on developer profiles or project listings.
* **Mutual Matches:** Get notified when there's a mutual "like" between developers and projects/collaborators.
* **In-App Messaging:** Communicate directly with matched developers or project owners.
* **Skill Tagging:** Efficiently categorize and search for specific skills and technologies.
* **Recommendation Engine (Future):** Intelligent recommendations for projects and collaborators based on profile data.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of DevTinder up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm or Yarn
* Git
* (If using a database) PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or your chosen database system.
* (If using a backend framework) Python/Django, Ruby/Rails, Go/Gin, etc.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/devtinder.git](https://github.com/yourusername/devtinder.git)
    cd devtinder
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend # or client, app, etc. depending on your project structure
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    cd ../backend # or server, api, etc.
    npm install # or pip install -r requirements.txt, bundle install, etc.
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in your `backend` directory (and `frontend` if needed) and add your environment-specific variables.
    Example `backend/.env`:

    ```
    PORT=5000
    DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database_name
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    # Add other necessary variables (e.g., API keys for external services)
    ```

5.  **Run database migrations (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    cd backend
    # Example for a Node.js project with Prisma:
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init

    # Example for Django:
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Start the development servers:**

    * **Frontend:**
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        npm start # or yarn start
        ```

    * **Backend:**
        ```bash
        cd backend
        npm run dev # or node index.js, python manage.py runserver, etc.
        ```

    Your frontend application should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or specified port) and your backend API at `http://localhost:5000` (or specified port).

## Usage

Once DevTinder is running:

1.  **Register/Log in:** Create a new developer account or log in with existing credentials.
2.  **Complete your profile:** Fill out your skills, experience, preferred technologies, and what kind of projects/collaborators you're looking for.
3.  **Browse and Swipe:** Start swiping through project listings or other developer profiles.
    * Swipe right (or click "Like") if you're interested.
    * Swipe left (or click "Pass") if it's not a match.
4.  **Check for Matches:** Head to your "Matches" section to see mutual connections.
5.  **Start Chatting:** Initiate conversations with your matches to discuss potential collaborations or project details.
